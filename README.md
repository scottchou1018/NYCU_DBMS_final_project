# Codeforces Team Helper
a codeforces team management system
Codeforces does not provide analysis features for teams. To address this, we have developed a website that allows for detailed comparisons between Codeforces teams.
## features

### Compare a Group of teams
The website enables you to compare the past practice records of different teams by grouping them together. It displays all contests in which at least one team in the group has participated. Additionally, it provides scoreboards for selected contests to facilitate detailed analysis.

### Automatic Data Update
Once teams are added, the backend server periodically fetches and updates their data, ensuring that all information remains up-to-date.

### User Management
CF Team Helper provides user features. Therefore, the teams and groups you create will be stored in the database. When you log in to the system next time, this data will be retained.
